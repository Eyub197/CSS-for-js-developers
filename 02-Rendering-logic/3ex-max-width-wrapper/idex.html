<!-- Specifically, our goal with a max-width wrapper is to fulfill these constraints:

It fills the available space on smaller viewports.
It sets a maximum width, and will horizontally center itself within the parent if there is leftover space.
It includes a bit of horizontal “breathing room”, so that its children aren't pressed right up against the edges of the viewport.
